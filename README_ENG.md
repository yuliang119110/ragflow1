# Welcome to Bisheng

## What is Bisheng

Bisheng is a leading open-source platform for developing LLM applications. It empowers and accelerates the development of LLM applications and helps users to enter the next generation of application development mode with the best experience.

"Bisheng" is the inventor of movable type printing, which played a huge role in the dissemination of human knowledge. We hope that "Bisheng" can also provide strong support for the widespread landing of intelligent applications. Welcome to participate together.

Bisheng was released under the Apache 2.0 License at the end of August 2023.


## Key Features

- Convenience: Even business person can quickly build intelligent applications centered around LLM through simple and intuitive form filling based on our pre-configured application templates.
- Flexibility: For person familiar with LLM technologies, we provide hundreds of development components following the latest trends in the LLM technology ecosystem. With visual and flexible process orchestration capabilities, any type of LLM application can be developed, not just simple prompting projects.
- Reliability and Enterprise-level: Many similar open-source projects are only suitable for experimental testing scenarios and lack enterprise-level features for real production use, including high availability under high concurrency, continuous iteration and optimization of application operations and effects, and practical functions that fit real business scenarios. These are the differentiated capabilities of the ByteDance platform. In addition, data quality within enterprises is uneven. To truly utilize all data, comprehensive unstructured data governance capabilities are needed, which is the core capability our team has accumulated over the past few years. In Bisheng's demo environment, you can directly access these capabilities through related components, and these capabilities are free and unlimited.


## Product Applications

With the Bisheng platform, we can build a variety of LLM applications:

Analysis Report Generation:

- 📃 Contract Review Report Generation
- 🏦 Credit Investigation Report Generation
- 📈 IPO Analysis Report Generation
- 💼 Intelligent Investment Advisory Report Generation
- 👀 Document Summary Generation


Knowledge Base Q&A:

- 👩‍💻 User Manual Q&A
- 👩‍🔬 Research Report Knowledge Base Q&A
- 🗄 Regulations and Rules Q&A
- 💊 "Chinese Pharmacopoeia" Knowledge Q&A
- 📊 Stock Price Database Q&A


Dialogues:

- 🎭 Role-play as an interviewer
- 📍 Xiaohongshu (Red Book) Copywriting Assistant
- 👩‍🎤 Role-play as a foreign language teacher
- 👨‍🏫 Resume Optimization Assistant


Element Extraction:

- 📄 Key Elements Extraction from Contracts
- 🏗️ Engineering Report Elements Extraction
- 🗂️ General Metadata Extraction
- 🎫 Key Elements Extraction from Cards and Bills


For methods to build various applications, see[Application Cases](https://m7a7tqsztt.feishu.cn/wiki/ZfkmwLPfeiAhQSkK2WvcX87unxc).

We believe that in real enterprise scenarios, "dialogue" is just one of many interaction forms. 
In the future, we will also add support for more application forms such as process automation and search.
